## Advent of code solutions


Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

These are my Advent of Code (AoC) solutions. The puzzles are solved using Python 3.10
